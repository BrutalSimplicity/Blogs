# LINQPad - Interactive C#

Firing up a Python or Ruby interpretter and scribbling away some code for rapid protoyping gives you quick insight into the viability of ideas and allows you to automate the mundane and humdrum. So why can't we do the same in C#? Well, guess what? You can, and it's completely free!

## Code N' Play

LINQPad is a tool that allows you to begin writing, testing, and executing your C#/F#/VB programs instantly. And better yet, it has many drivers that allow it to communicate with a myriad of data sources (SqlServer, Sqlite, Mysql, Oracle, ...). The engine behind it is pretty resourceful, and can handle nearly anything you can throw at it. And my favorite feature of all, is it's ultra-convenient `Dump()` command that allows you to output seemingly any type of data in a neatly formatted table that can immediately be exported in Excel, Word, or HTML. 

Okay, enough talk let's see it in action.
